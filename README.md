# MazeRun
Unity game

Generates maze for a player to find all key pieces before they are caught by the local minotaur (what maze dosen't have one).
Maze size and wall sparsity are specificed in game setup, but each maze is made randomly and without islands. Every two points in the maze are connected.

Minotaur patrols maze randomly until the player is seen.
Includes all maze creation scripts, Menu and character movement controllers.
